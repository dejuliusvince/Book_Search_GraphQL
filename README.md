# Book_Search_GraphQL

## Description 
This application contains a partially refactored full stack application allowing users to login and save books to their profile using the googlebooks API. The RESTful API has will be completely replaced with graphql queries and mutations throughout future development, but for now the login and save book functionality has been converted from REST API to graphql query and mutation respectively. 

An Apollo server has been applied to the express.js server as middleware, and schema settings for resolvers/typedefs have been written according to the assignment instructions. However, the front end functionality of fetching a user's saved books and signing up a new user, still must be converted to graphql queries/mutations.

Time constraints have prevented the full functionality from being implemented. This will be addressed throughout future development.
